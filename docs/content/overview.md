# Overview

Productâ€™s working name is Drups.io.

Drups.io is meant to be the open source project. It will be the collection of software pieces (front-end applications, back-end services and necessary devops scripts) which together assemble the build & deploy automation service for Drupal projects (similar to Netlify build, Vercel and others).

This document describes (1) the problem we face with build & deploy automation when developing drupal projects and (2) in-depth architectural and structural design of the solution along with picked programming languages, necessary tools, libraries and frameworks for implementation.
